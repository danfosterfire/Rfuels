Description: This package includes code and supporting documentation for a 
    method to calculate total fuel loads from Brown's transects
    for Sierra Nevada tree species. This method was 
    originally developed by Jason Moghaddas and Scott 
    Stephens, and relies on the work of many others (see documentation). The 
    purpose of this package is to implement the method in R for improved 
    usability, repeatability, and clarity. The R implementation 
    was developed by Danny Foster in 2017-2018, with financial support from the 
    Baker-Bidwell Continuing Fellowship.

# Rfuels
Scripts and documentation for estimating Sierra Nevadan surface fuels from Brown's transects

## Todo

update this readme



### complete and update function documentation (done except for examples)
#### add examples

### include some example load estimates from the literature for a sanity check

### do other package prep stuff
  - citation, etc. follow wickham

### include the option to simplify calculations and just use Brown's coefficients

### compare by-stand, by-plot, and browns-only results, document the comparison
(and the variance) in the vignette

### include some example statistical analysis??? probably a bridge too far
